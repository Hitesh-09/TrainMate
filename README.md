# 🚆 TrainMate — Smarter Train Availability & Route Planner

## 💡 Problem Statement

Train booking platforms often leave users stranded when tickets are waitlisted. Travelers are forced to manually explore alternate routes, nearby stations, or break journeys — a tedious and time-consuming task.

## 🎯 Objective

SmartTrain is a user-friendly web application that simplifies train journey planning by automatically suggesting:
- Trains from nearby stations
- Alternate boarding/destination points
- Break journey options across India

All in one place — quick, efficient, and stress-free.
